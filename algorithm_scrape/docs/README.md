Application Overview (v1 Beta)
===================

Django Data Models in respect to scrapping
===================
```
class Product(models.Model):
    product_name = models.CharField()
    product_price = CurrencyField()
    product_slug_url = models.URLField()
    product_category = models.CharField()
    product_image = CloudinaryField()
    product_website_name = models.CharField()
    date_added = models.DateTimeField()
    last_modified = models.DateTimeField()
    active = models.BooleanField()
    **website = models.ForeignKey()**

class Website(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField()
    description = models.TextField()
    website_slug = models.SlugField()
    site_logo_image = CloudinaryField()
    menswear = models.BooleanField()
    womenswear = models.BooleanField()
    active = models.BooleanField()
    date_added = models.DateTimeField()
    last_modified = models.DateTimeField()
```
Scrape Algorithm
=============
write below
Registered Website Id's
===================
> name_of_website = website_id

- Maison Kitsune = 1
- Hotel 1171 = 2
- Nu* New York = 3
- Project No.8 = 4
- Miss Hoe = 5
- Reformation = 6
- Trade-Mark = 7


Registering a website for products to be viewed
==============

1. Add a "website" to the website model in the django admin area. Initially the field(s) `active`  will be **detonated with no checkmark** and  `website slug` field will be left **blank**. Indicating the current registered "website" has a status of **In-Process**  and the "website" is being tested for scrapping products using the `Scrape Algorithm`. Moreover, you should see the id value for the website in the breadcrumb right above ( Change Websites ) **Home › Website › Websites › website_id **. This will be the value used in Step **2.** to match the "website" with the correct products in the db when we scrape the items.
 
2. Next create a `_websitename_views.py` file in `scrap` directory in Django for the registered "website" being scrapped.  Import the methods DataCompiler() and Website_name() from the `Scrape Algorithm`,  into the `_websitename_views.py` file. See algorithm_scrape/docs/`_websitename_views.py` in github for a skeleton file and detailed instructions for this step inside. After setting up the view add these lines of code below (with the specific information for the site ) in scrap/`urls.py` 
```
from scrap._websitename_views.py import function_name_from_view

url(r'^_internal/websitename_api/', function_name_from_view),
```
*Do not add any underscores or dashes to websitename. It should be all undercase letters and no spaces e.g. trademark, zara, reformation.

3. We now setup a cron job to the API link to call and scrape the site every XX-day at XX:XX time. To get new products or update any fields that may have changed on the products. On the front-end if users are  signed up with our app they get a email notifications when we get new products for a particular "website" **(They Follow Only)**. This happens only when after we scrap and the "website" they follow gets a new instance of products stored in the db.
